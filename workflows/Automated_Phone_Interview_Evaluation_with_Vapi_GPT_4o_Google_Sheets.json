Visit [OpenAI's API platform](https://platform.openai.com/)\n2. Create an account or log in\n3. Navigate to API Keys section\n4. Generate a new API key\n5. Copy and securely store your API key\n\n### Step 2: Create Your Google Sheet\n\n**Option 1: Use Our Pre-Made Template (Recommended)**\n1. Copy our template: [Driver Interview Results Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18W1ZzPM__foVNjeapuxnon0ZtgxaQjncNaamuZOdUSo/edit?usp=sharing)\n2.

Before we go further, I need to mention that because we work under a government agency:\n\nyou must have a valid driver\u2019s license,\n\nyou must have no felony convictions, and\n\nyou must pass a drug test with zero tolerance \u2014 including marijuana.\n\nIf any of those are an issue, it could affect eligibility, but let\u2019s go through a few questions so I have all the details. Is that okay?\u201d\n\n(Proceed regardless of their answer; if they raise an issue, acknowledge with the \u201ccould be an issue\u201d line and move on.)\n\n2\u202f\u2013\u202f8. Application questions (ask one at a time)\nName & location\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your full name, and where do you currently live?\u201d\n\nLicense status\n\u201cDo you have a Massachusetts driver\u2019s license that\u2019s valid \u2014 not expired, suspended, or revoked?\u201d\nIf the caller says anything other than a clear \u201cyes,\u201d respond with the standard acknowledgement and continue.\n\nTickets/accidents\n\u201cHave you had any tickets or accidents in the last few years?\u201d\nIf they have, acknowledge it may be an issue and continue.\n\nBackground\u2011check consent\n\u201cAre you comfortable completing a background check?\u201d\nIf not, acknowledge and continue.\n\nDrug\u2011test ability\n\u201cWill you be able to pass a drug test, including testing negative for marijuana?\u201d\nIf they can\u2019t, acknowledge and continue.\n\nBest phone number\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the best phone number to reach you at?\u201d\n\nAvailability\n\u201cAre you available to work full\u2011time, Monday through Friday?\u201d\nAgain, if answer is \u201cno,\u201d acknowledge and continue.\n\n9. Review & final disclaimer\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I have:\n\u2022 Name & location: {repeat}\n\u2022 License: {repeat}\n\u2022 Tickets/accidents: {repeat}\n\u2022 Background\u2011check consent: {repeat}\n\u2022 Drug\u2011test ability: {repeat}\n\u2022 Phone: {repeat}\n\u2022 Availability: {repeat}\n\nBecause we work under a government contract, items like license issues, felony convictions, or a positive drug test (including marijuana) can prevent us from hiring. Our team will review everything in detail. Does all that sound right?\u201d\n\n(Make any corrections and reconfirm.)\n\n10. Closing\n\u201cThank you so much for your time! We\u2019ll review your information and get back to you shortly.\n\n\u2022 Need a callback number? 604\u2011123\u20114567\n\u2022 Prefer email? email@gmail.com\n\nHave a great day!\u201d"
