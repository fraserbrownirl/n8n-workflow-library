        "content": "# Workflow Note: Website Lead Notification System\n\n---\n\n### **Problem**\nDelayed responses to new website leads can lead to a significant loss of business. When form submissions are only sent to a general email inbox, it often takes too long for the sales team to notice and act on them. This slow response time results in a poor prospect experience and allows competitors to get ahead.\n\n### **Solution**\nThis is a simple but highly effective n8n workflow designed to eliminate response delays. By connecting your website's contact form directly to your team's communication channels, the system ensures that every new lead is instantly captured and a real-time notification is sent. This allows your sales team to act immediately, significantly improving lead-to-conversion rates.\n\n### **For Whom**\nThis workflow is ideal for **small businesses, e-commerce stores, freelancers, and marketing professionals** who need to respond quickly to new business inquiries. It is perfect for anyone who wants to ensure that no lead falls through the cracks and that their sales pipeline remains robust.\n\n### **Scope**\n* **What it includes:**\n    * An instant trigger for every form submission from your website.\n    * Real-time notifications delivered directly to a specified Slack channel.\n    * Optional automatic archiving of lead data into a Google Sheet.\n    * Optional immediate and personalized confirmation emails sent to the new lead.\n\n* **What it excludes:**\n    * Advanced lead scoring or qualification.\n    * Integration with a complex CRM system (though it can be easily extended to do so).\n    * Automated follow-up sequences.\n\n### **How to Set Up**\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:** You will need an n8n instance and accounts for **Slack**, **Google Sheets**, and **Gmail**. Your website's contact form must be able to send data via an HTTP `POST` request to a specific URL.\n2.  **Workflow Import:** Import the workflow's `.json` file into your n8n instance.\n3.  **Credential Configuration:**\n    * Set up credentials for **Slack**, **Google Sheets**, and **Gmail** within n8n.\n4.  **Node-Specific Configuration:**\n    * **`Webhook Trigger`:** Click the node and copy the **Webhook URL**. You must paste this URL into your website's form settings as the submission endpoint.\n    * **`Slack` Node:** Enter the `Channel ID` of the Slack channel where you want notifications to be sent.\n    * **`Google Sheets` Node (Optional):** Enter your `Spreadsheet ID` and `Sheet Name`. Map the form data fields (e.g., `{{ $json.name }}`) to the corresponding columns in your spreadsheet.\n    * **`Gmail` Node (Optional):** Enter the `To` field using the lead's email variable (`{{ $json.email }}`) and customize the subject and body of the confirmation email.\n5.  **Activation:** After all configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** and then **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live!"
