It simplifies the process by integrating various tasks, from fetching the RSS file to ensuring proper file formatting. The end goal is to have your podcast episode live on Spotify with minimal manual intervention.\n\n### How it works:\n- \ud83d\udfe2 **Manual Trigger:** Initiates the workflow when you click 'Execute workflow'.\n- \ud83d\udcc4 **Get RSS File:** Fetches the latest RSS feed file using GitHub.\n- \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f **Add New Episode:** Prepares the data for the new episode.\n- \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f **Input Data:** Sets necessary parameters for the episode, including title and description.\n- \ud83c\udfa7 **Read Audio File:** Accesses the audio file generated from the previous steps.\n- \u2601\ufe0f **Upload to Google Drive:** Stores the audio file on Google Drive.\n- \ud83d\udd17 **Set Public URL:** Creates a public link for sharing the podcast episode.\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Convert to JSON:** Formats the necessary information to ensure compatibility.\n- \ud83d\udd27 **Edit a File in GitHub:** Updates the repository with the new episode data.\n\n### Parameters to configure:\n- Spotify API credentials (Client ID, Secret)\n- Google Drive folder settings (permissions, location)\n- RSS URL for fetching updates\n\n### Limitations / Gotchas:\n- Ensure Spotify account is set up and linked to the RSS feed before executing.\n- The audio file must meet Spotify's format requirements.\n\n### Expected result\nThe successful execution results in a new podcast episode being uploaded to Spotify, accessible via the provided RSS link.\n\n\n\n### \ud83d\udcec Need help or want to collaborate?\nIf you have any questions, need help setting this up, or want to share feedback \u2014 feel free to reach out:  \n\ud83d\udce9 **Luis.acosta@news2podcast.com** or DM me on Twitter [@guanchehacker](http://www.x.com/GuancheHacker).  \nIf you're looking to build something more advanced with audio and AI, let me know and I\u2019ll figure out how I can help you!"
