        "content": "# Automated Domain/IP Blacklist Monitor\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Problem\n\n*The core problem we're solving:** Our email deliverability and sender reputation are at risk if our domain or IP addresses are listed on spam blacklists. Manual, ad-hoc checks are inefficient and often reactive, meaning we only discover a problem after emails are already bouncing or being marked as spam. This can lead to a loss of customer trust and business.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Solution\n\n*How this workflow addresses the problem:** This automated workflow proactively monitors our key domains and IP addresses against major blacklists. It will automatically check for new listings on a set schedule and send immediate alerts to the appropriate team members if a blacklisting is detected. This allows us to react quickly, identify the root cause, and initiate the delisting process before our reputation is severely impacted.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc65 For Whom\n\n**Who will use this system:**\n* *System Administrators:** To monitor the health of our email servers and network infrastructure.\n* *Marketing Team:** To ensure email campaigns reach their audience and maintain a high sender reputation.\n* *Security Team:** To quickly identify potential compromised systems or malicious activity on our network that could be causing the blacklisting.\n* *IT Support:** To respond to support tickets from customers about email delivery issues.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf10 Scope\n\n**What is included:**\n* Automatic, scheduled checks of all specified domains and IP addresses against a list of major blacklists (e.g., Spamhaus, Barracuda, SpamCop).\n* Real-time notifications (e.g., via email, Slack, or a ticket system) upon detection of a blacklisting event.\n* A centralized dashboard or log for viewing the status of all monitored assets.\n\n**What is out of scope:**\n* *Automatic delisting:** This workflow does not automatically request delisting. Delisting requires a manual investigation to address the underlying problem and a formal request to the blacklist provider.\n* *Root cause analysis:** The system will not automatically determine why an IP or domain was blacklisted. This requires human investigation.\n* *Internal mail server log analysis:** While the monitor can point to a problem, it does not analyze internal email logs to find the source of the spam.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Set Up\n\nFollow these steps to set up the automated blacklist monitor:\n\n1.  **Choose a Monitoring Service:** Select a reliable blacklist monitoring service (e.g., HetrixTools, MXToolBox, or a similar platform).\n2.  **Create an Account:** Sign up for the service and set up your organization's account.\n3.  **Add Monitored Assets:**\n    * Navigate to the \"Monitors\" or \"Assets\" section.\n    * Add each of our core domains (e.g., `ourcompany.com`) and all relevant outbound mail server IP addresses.\n4.  **Configure Notifications:**\n    * Set up notification channels for alerts. This could be an email to `security@ourcompany.com` or a dedicated Slack channel (`#blacklist-alerts`).\n    * Customize the notification frequency and details to ensure the alerts are actionable.\n5.  **Review the Dashboard:** Familiarize yourself with the system's dashboard. This will be your central point for reviewing the status of all monitored assets and viewing historical data.\n6.  **Set an Action Plan:** Document the steps to take when an alert is received, including:\n    * Immediately notifying the security and IT teams.\n    * Opening an incident ticket.\n    * Beginning the root cause analysis.\n    * Documenting the delisting process."
