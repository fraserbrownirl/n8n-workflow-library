This prevents errors if an email without an attachment somehow triggers the workflow.\n\nUpload to Google Drive:\n\nA Google Drive node receives the email data and its attachments.\n\nIt's configured to upload these attachments to a specific folder in your Google Drive.\n\nThe attachments are named dynamically based on their original filenames.\n\n\n\n"

Save it.\n\nClick New Credential again.\n\nSearch for and select \"Google Drive OAuth2 API\" and follow the authentication steps with your Google account. Save it.\n\nMake note of the Credential Names (e.g., \"My Gmail Account\", \"My Google Drive Account\").\n\nStep 2: Create a Destination Folder in Google Drive\n\nGo to your Google Drive (drive.google.com).\n\nCreate a new folder where you want to save the email attachments (e.g., Email Attachments Archive).\n\nCopy the Folder ID from the URL (e.g., https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE)."
