FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n   - Begin immediately with valid HTML - no markdown, backticks, or explanations\n   - First line must be raw HTML (e.g., <div>, <section>, etc.)\n   - Use semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <section>, <h1>-<h3>, <p>, <ul>, <table>, etc.)\n   - Include minimal inline CSS for readability (headings, spacing, colors)\n   - Create a mobile-responsive design\n\n2. CONTENT STRUCTURE:\n   - Title: \"Prospect Research Report: [Prospect Name]\"\n   - Executive Summary: 2-3 sentence overview highlighting key connection opportunities\n   - Background: Professional history, current role, company information\n   - Personal Interests: Hobbies, causes, affiliations\n   - Connection Points: Shared interests, experiences, or network connections with prospector\n   - Engagement Strategy: Suggested talking points and approach\n   - Sources: All references with properly formatted citations\n\n3. CITATION HANDLING:\n   - Every external reference must be a clickable link (<a href=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\">Source Name</a>)\n   - Include the full visible URL text after each citation (e.g., \"Source Name (https://example.com)\")\n   - Group citations by section at the bottom of each relevant area\n\n4. DATA PROCESSING:\n   - Merge and synthesize all information from the research data\n   - Eliminate redundancies while preserving all unique insights\n   - When conflicting information exists, note both versions with sources\n   - If critical information is missing, note this briefly rather than claiming more research is needed\n\n5. INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION HANDLING:\n   - If multiple people with the same/similar names were found, create a section called \"IDENTITY VERIFICATION NEEDED\"\n   - In this section, list the different individuals found with distinguishing details for each\n   - Include a clear HTML-formatted recommendation box suggesting specific additional information needed:\n     \u2022 \"Please request a new research report with the following information to ensure accurate identification:\"\n     \u2022 Request social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)\n     \u2022 Request company name, location, or other distinguishing professional details\n     \u2022 Request any personal details that might help distinguish from others with similar names\n   - If general information is sparse (regardless of identity clarity), include an \"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED\" section\n   - List specific types of missing information that would improve the report's usefulness\n   - Format these recommendations prominently in a bordered box with a distinct background color\n\n6. PERSONALIZATION:\n   - The prospect is {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospect Name'] }}\n   - The prospector is {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospector Name'] }}\n   - Address the report directly to the prospector\n   - Focus on actionable insights that enable meaningful connection\n   - Highlight 2-3 specific conversation starters based on the prospect's interests or background\n\n7. TONE AND STYLE:\n   - Professional but conversational\n   - Concise with bullet points where appropriate\n   - Scannable with clear headings and short paragraphs\n   - Objective but warm - focus on factual information presented in a helpful manner\n\n8. INPUT DATA:\n{{ $json.output }}\n\nThis report should serve as a comprehensive but easily digestible guide that empowers the prospector to make an authentic personal connection with the prospect.",

Your research must be thorough, accurate, and strategically aligned with the outreach goal.\n\nPROSPECT: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospect Name'] }}\nPROSPECTOR: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospector Name'] }}\nOUTREACH GOAL: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Outreach Goal'] }}\n\n## PROVIDED SOCIAL PROFILES\n\n### PROSPECT PROFILES\n- LinkedIn: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospect Linkedin URL'] }}\n- Twitter: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospect Twitter URL'] }}\n- Instagram:{{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospect Instagram URL'] }}\n\n### PROSPECTOR PROFILES\n- LinkedIn: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospector Linkedin URL'] }}\n- Twitter: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospector Twitter URL'] }}\n- Instagram: {{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json['Prospector Instagram URL'] }}\n\n## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n### 1. PROFILE VERIFICATION\n- Verify that all provided profiles belong to the correct individuals\n- If multiple people share the same name, document distinguishing characteristics\n- Flag any uncertainty about profile ownership with clear reasoning\n\n### 2. DEPTH-FIRST RESEARCH APPROACH\n- For each valid social profile, extract and document:\n  * Professional history and achievements\n  * Educational background\n  * Geographic history (past and present locations)\n  * Interests, hobbies, and passions\n  * Values and causes they support\n  * Content themes they engage with\n  * Posting patterns and engagement style\n  * Key relationships and networking patterns\n- For each extracted data point, include the exact URL source\n\n### 3. EXPANDED SEARCH BEYOND PROVIDED PROFILES\n- Search for additional online presence (other platforms, websites, etc.)\n- Locate published content (articles, interviews, presentations)\n- Find event participation (conferences, webinars, panels)\n- Identify organizational affiliations (professional, volunteer, social)\n- Discover mentions in media and third-party sources\n- Document each new source with complete URLs\n\n## CONNECTION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\n\nSystematically identify and evaluate potential connection points in these categories:\n\n1. PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS\n   - Shared employers or business partners\n   - Industry overlap and similar roles\n   - Professional organizations/groups\n   - Mentors/colleagues in common\n   - Parallel career trajectories\n\n2. EDUCATIONAL INTERSECTIONS\n   - Shared alma maters (any level)\n   - Similar fields of study\n   - Overlapping time periods at institutions\n   - Notable professors or programs in common\n\n3. GEOGRAPHIC CONNECTIONS\n   - Current location proximity\n   - Shared previous locations\n   - Regional cultural references or affiliations\n\n4. PERSONAL ALIGNMENT\n   - Common interests and hobbies\n   - Shared values and causes\n   - Similar content engagement patterns\n   - Complementary personality indicators\n\n5. NETWORK OVERLAP\n   - Mutual connections (1st, 2nd, 3rd degree)\n   - Shared event attendance\n   - Common group memberships\n   - Similar audience engagement\n\n## HANDLING INFORMATION GAPS\n\nIf initial searches yield insufficient information:\n\n1. IDENTITY VERIFICATION ISSUES\n   - Expand search parameters to include alternative spellings, nicknames, or maiden names\n   - Search for company affiliations + name combinations\n   - Cross-reference with mentions in industry publications or events\n   - If multiple potential matches persist, document each with distinguishing characteristics\n\n2. INSUFFICIENT CONNECTION DATA\n   - Expand search beyond standard social platforms to niche forums, local news, alumni directories\n   - Investigate company websites, team pages, and press releases\n   - Look for content collaborations, co-authored works, panel discussions\n   - Search for comments and interactions on third-party content\n   - Explore professional repositories like GitHub, SlideShare, or Medium\n\n## CITATION AND SOURCING REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Every factual claim must include an inline citation with the complete URL\n- Format: [Claim or information]. (SOURCE: https://full.url.here)\n- Include a comprehensive source list at the end of each section\n- Evaluate and note the credibility/recency of each source\n- For social media sources, include specific post dates where possible\n\n## OUTPUT FORMATTING\n\nYour research report must:\n\n1. Begin directly with substantive findings - no preamble or methodology explanation\n2. Use clear hierarchical headings for easy navigation\n3. Employ bullet points and numbered lists for scannable content\n4. Bold key connection points and high-value insights\n5. Include a \"Priority Connection Opportunities\" section at the beginning\n6. Maximize length through RELEVANT information only\n7. Include all source URLs both inline and in a comprehensive reference section\n\nYour output will be processed by another system, so strict adherence to these formatting guidelines is essential.",
