Trying to HTTP the API will cause the request to time out do to the size of the file This workflow will help set you up for more Sleeper workflows for your fantasy leagues by syncing aactive players to a table vs calling on them from Sleeper everytime. \n\nSleeper has players table of every player that ever played but in order to utilize the information for your roster, it needs to be filtered for active players. From there Player_ID fields can give you access to roster information.\n\nAll you'll need is an Airtable (can be used with Supabase,  Google Sheet etc) and the API call. From there, its is converted & filtered for all active NFL players & will update as player activity changes."
