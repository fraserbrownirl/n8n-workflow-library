That profile is then scraped using Relevance AI to extract posts, experiences, and education. It also runs a deep-dive query on the person using Perplexity to uncover relevant news, insights, and context. This structured data is passed to an AI model that produces a clean profile summary, suggested pain points, and solution ideas. Finally, the system builds and sends you a fully formatted HTML report via email\u2014ready to review before your meeting.\n\n### Who\u2019s it for\n- Founders taking high-stakes sales calls  \n- SDRs/BDRs booking back-to-back meetings  \n- Agencies and consultants who want to personalize discovery calls  \n- Teams doing high-touch enterprise sales or B2B outreach  \n\n### How it works\n- Triggered when a new call is booked via Cal.com  \n- Finds matching LinkedIn URL from a local database (Google Sheets)  \n- Scrapes public LinkedIn data via Relevance AI  \n- Runs a Perplexity query on the prospect for deeper context  \n- Formats the scraped data using Code nodes  \n- Sends structured info to AI to generate:\n  - A company + person profile  \n  - Suggested pain points and solutions  \n- Formats everything into a clean HTML report  \n- Emails you the final summary to prep for the call\n\n### Example use case\n> Someone books a call. You receive a report 2 minutes later in your inbox with:  \n> - Their role, company, and latest posts  \n> - What their business does  \n> - Recent news and context from Perplexity  \n> - Predicted pain points and how you might help  \n>  \n> You show up to the call prepped and ready\n\n### How to set up\n1. Connect your Cal.com trigger (or replace with any booking tool)  \n2. Set up your Google Sheet(s) with contact info + LinkedIn profiles  \n3. Add Relevance AI API key and configure LinkedIn scraping (they have free credits)  \n4. Link Perplexity API for web research  \n5. Customize the AI prompts and report formatting  \n6. Connect Gmail or preferred email provider to send reports\n\n### Requirements\n- Cal.com or other booking platform  \n- Google Sheets for lead storage  \n- Relevance AI account and API access  \n- Perplexity API key  \n- OpenAI or similar LLM for summarization  \n- Email integration (e.g. Gmail)\n\n### How to customize\n- Replace Cal.com with Calendly, SavvyCal, etc.  \n- Change AI prompt tone and structure of the report  \n- Add CRM push (e.g. log into HubSpot, Notion, or Airtable)  \n- Add Slack or Telegram notifications for call alerts  \n- Format reports as PDF instead of HTML for download\n"

Every single person I knew told me I was ruining my life.\n\nBut I swung big, turned my side project into a real company, and turned controversy into over $5M ARR in 2 months.\n\nNow, I\u2019m swinging bigger than I\u2019ve ever done before.\n\nCluely will transform the way humans use AI.\n\nCluely lives in the background of your computer\u2014reading your screen, eavesdropping on your calls, and surfacing the exact insights and questions you need before you even know you need them.

I never met a single student who didn\u2019t use AI to get through their classes.\n\nThe information you get with a \u201ccollege education\u201d is becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\n- Admissions are a lottery\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty clear that admissions promote diversity over true merit. \n\nThe greatest example of this I\u2019ve seen is from Zach Yadegari (18 y.o. with a 4.0 GPA & $30M ARR business who got rejected by 15/18 top colleges). \n\nThere are countless stories like his that show how meaningless a college acceptance really is. \n\n- Top talent can be found anywhere\n\nElite schools love to brand themselves as the birthplace for people who change the world. \n\nThe truth is, the most talented people I\u2019ve seen (and hired) didn\u2019t come from prestigious universities \u2013 one of our best engineers is a random furry I met in community college. \n\nTalented people can be found anywhere, and your school name shouldn\u2019t dictate where you\u2019re able to work or your potential for success. \n\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: \n\nYou go to college to find a co-founder and a wife. That\u2019s it. \n\nP.S.

I used it to get offers at top tech companies, like Amazon, Meta, Tiktok, and Capital One. After posting about it publicly to market the tool, I got blacklisted from big tech and kicked out of Columbia University.\n\nBut I immediately realized that the technology we built wasn't just a great tool for cheating on technical interviews; it's likely the future of how humans will interact with AI.\n\nToday, people are using Cluely in sales calls, meetings, recruiting, and so much more.\n\nThe potential for AI is limited because it's stuck behind a chatbot.\n\nWe're just getting started.\n\nIf you're excited about the potential of AI beyond the limits of a textbox, and in our unique ability to consistently go hyper viral, check us out.\n\nWe're hiring: www.cluely.com/careers.</p>\n      <p><em>Posted on: 2025-06-20</em></p>\n    </div><div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n      <p>Cluely just threw the most legendary party that never happened.\n\nWe spent $20,000.\n\nOver 2,000 people showed up within 16 minutes.\n\nAnd then... the whole thing got shut down.\n\nEvery single unit of SFPD (and even the National Guard) came to tell people to leave. \n\nIf there\u2019s anything to take away from this, you should just know that Cluely\u2019s aura makes anything go viral\u2026 \n\nP.S.

In <2 months since our launch, we\u2019ve scaled to over $5M ARR. \n\nIf you\u2019re scared of AI replacing your job, here are two things I recommend: \n\n1) Take more risks. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the world is going to look like in 5 years. Nobody does. \n\nBut I do know that AI is quickly giving everyone access to the same tools, code, and creative shortcuts.\n\nThis means that you if you want to set yourself apart, you need to be willing to take risks.\u00a0 \n\nEvery single piece of success I\u2019ve had over the past few months has come from trusting my gut when everyone else told me not to. \n\n2) Learn how to go viral. \n\nAI makes it easier than ever to replicate products. What\u2019s hard now is getting attention.\n\nThat\u2019s what people mean when they say \u201cdistribution is the last moat\u201d. \n\nWhen we were brainstorming our first product (Interview Coder), we thought about what kind of product would go viral \u2013 and worked backwards. This strategy worked extremely well, and helped us break over $3M in ARR after getting hundreds of millions of views on social media. \n\nIf you can learn to take massive risks and get the right people to see it, I genuinely believe the AI era will become the most rewarding time for you to be alive.\n\nP.S.

Since launching less than 2 months ago, we\u2019ve gotten over 70,000 active users and hit $5M ARR. \n\nIf there\u2019s something I learned, it\u2019s that you need to really swing big if you want a big result. \n\nCutting off all my other opportunities (college, big-tech, etc) was the biggest risk I\u2019d taken at the time, and I\u2019m more glad than ever that I went all in. \n\nP.S.

              "content": "**Cluely** is a technology startup developing a novel **AI interface that serves as an ambient desktop layer**, providing **real-time, context-aware answers** directly over the user's screen. Its solution is designed to be **undetectable**, meaning it overlays information during high-context tasks\u2014such as sales calls, interviews, exams, or other forms of deep work\u2014without requiring users to switch apps or windows[1][3][5]. Here are the core aspects of Cluely based on current research:\n\n**What Cluely Does**\n- **Ambient AI Overlay:** Cluely's software listens to audio, sees what is on the user's screen, and proactively surfaces contextual information or responses, such as definitions, talking points, or answers, via simple keyboard prompts[1][5].\n- **Real-Time Assistance:** The AI instantly delivers help in real time during conversations or workflows, supporting users in scenarios that demand quick, informed responses, especially for **call centers, customer support teams, sales, recruiting, meetings, and exams**[1][3][4][5].\n- **Undetectable & Confidential:** Its functionality is built to be discreet, enabling users to receive information during live calls or tests without being noticed, which the founders have controversially pitched as helping people \"cheat\" on interviews, exams, and sales calls[1][3][4][5].\n\n**Target Users and Use Cases**\n- **Enterprise Adoption:** Cluely is seeing significant adoption in enterprise environments, particularly in **call centers and customer support**, where real-time contextual assistance can improve employee performance[1].\n- **Consumer Awareness:** While enterprise usage is its primary revenue driver, Cluely also targets individual users (e.g., students, sales professionals, job seekers) who benefit from unobtrusive on-screen support[1][3][4].\n\n**Founders and Backstory**\n- **Founded by Roy Lee and Neel Shanmugam** in early 2025. Both were previously suspended from Columbia University for creating \"Interview Coder,\" an undetectable AI tool for technical interviews. Lee is known for a provocative social media style and producing attention-grabbing videos that have attracted significant attention to the company[3].\n- Cluely's CEO, Roy Lee, has publicly emphasized the tool's ability to provide invisible guidance, a feature that sets it apart from traditional chatbot or sidebar-based assistants[1][3].\n\n**Funding and Growth**\n- **Raised $15 million in a Series A round** in June 2025, led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), bringing total funding to over $20 million. The round followed a $5.3 million seed round co-led by Abstract Ventures and Susa Ventures[1][3].\n- The company's post-money valuation is estimated to be around $120 million, according to outside investors[3].\n- The company claims to be profitable, with rapidly growing enterprise contracts surpassing consumer revenue[1][3].\n\n**Product Experience**\n- Users can customize the AI's assistance by sharing personal information or using default templates for common scenarios (school, meetings, sales, recruiting, customer support), allowing for highly personalized real-time help[4].\n- The company markets itself with the slogan: **\"Everything You Need. Before You Ask.\"**[5]\n\n**Legal and Ethical Stance**\n- Cluely emphasizes privacy in its policy and reserves the right to update these practices as its services evolve[2].\n- Due to its undetectable nature and focus on enabling users to \"cheat\" in various settings, Cluely has generated controversy and debate about its ethical implications, especially regarding academic and professional integrity[3].\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                  | Details                                                                 | Sources   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Product                 | Undetectable AI overlay for real-time, on-screen assistance             | [1][3][5] |\n| Target Markets          | Call centers, customer support, sales, recruiting, education, consumers | [1][3][4] |\n| Funding                 | $20M+ total; $15M Series A (a16z)                                       | [1][3]    |\n| Founders                | Roy Lee, Neel Shanmugam                                                 | [3]       |\n| Differentiators         | Sees screen, hears calls, surfaces answers undetectably                 | [1][3][5] |\n| Controversy             | Used to \"cheat\" on interviews, exams, and calls; ethical debates        | [3][4]    |\n| Profitability           | Company claims to be profitable                                         | [3]       |\n\nFor more information, their official website is [cluely.com][5]."
