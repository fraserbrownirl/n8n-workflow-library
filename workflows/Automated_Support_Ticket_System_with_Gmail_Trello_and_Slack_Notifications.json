Without a proper system, customer inquiries can get lost, leading to delayed response times and customer frustration. The lack of an automated confirmation for the customer leaves them in the dark, which can severely damage trust and brand reputation.\n\n### **Solution**\nThis is a straightforward but powerful n8n workflow designed to professionalize your customer support process. By integrating your support email with a project management or ticketing tool, the system ensures that every incoming support email is automatically converted into a trackable ticket. Simultaneously, it sends an instant, personalized confirmation email to the customer, providing them with peace of mind that their request has been received and is being handled.\n\n### **For Whom**\nThis workflow is ideal for **small businesses, e-commerce stores, and startups** that are growing their customer base and need a simple, effective way to manage support inquiries. It's a perfect solution for teams that want to transition from a messy shared inbox to an organized, responsive ticketing system without investing in an expensive, complex platform.\n\n### **Scope**\n* **What it includes:**\n    * An instant trigger for every new email sent to your support inbox.\n    * Automatic creation of a new ticket (e.g., a Trello card) with all the email details.\n    * An immediate, automated email reply to the customer confirming their message was received.\n    * Optional real-time notifications to your support team on Slack.\n\n* **What it excludes:**\n    * Advanced ticket routing or assignment logic.\n    * Automated follow-up sequences.\n    * Integration with a knowledge base or FAQ system.\n\n### **How to Set Up**\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:** You will need an n8n instance and accounts for **Gmail**, **Trello** (or a similar tool), and optionally **Slack**.\n2.  **Workflow Import:** Import the workflow's `.json` file into your n8n instance.\n3.  **Credential Configuration:**\n    * Set up credentials for **Gmail**, **Trello**, and **Slack** within n8n.\n4.  **Node-Specific Configuration:**\n    * **`Gmail Trigger`:** Specify the email address that will be monitored for new support requests.\n    * **`Trello` Node:** Enter your `Board ID` and the `List ID` where you want new tickets to be created.\n    * **`Gmail` Node:** Customize the automated confirmation email's subject and body to reflect your brand's voice.\n    * **`Slack` Node (Optional):** Enter the `Channel ID` for your support team's communication channel.\n5.  **Activation:** After all configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** and then **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live and will automatically manage your support inquiries."
